[Incubating] Problems report is available at: file:///E:/Mobile%20Aps/Bradflow/android/build/reports/problems/problems-report.html

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file 'E:\Mobile Aps\Bradflow\node_modules\@capacitor\android\capacitor\build.gradle' line: 57

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating project ':capacitor-android'.
> `getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt')` is no longer supported since it includes `-dontoptimize`, which prevents R8 from performing many optimizations. Instead use `getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt)`, and if needed, temporarily use `-dontoptimize` in a custom keep rule file while fixing breakages.

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to generate a Build Scan (Powered by Develocity).
